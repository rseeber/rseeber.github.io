                        <h2>New paper about Noncomplience with Cybersecurity standards in Universities and Colleges of USA</h2>
                        <p><em>September 11, 2024</em></p>
                        <p>I
                            recently read a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00546">research
                            paper</a> over on Arxiv.org about cybersecurity in higher education.
                            The researches found that nearly all higher education institutions
                            are heavily lagging behind in updating their cybersecurity policies
                            as new standards are released by NIST. The paper, published August
                            2024, found that even high level, prestigious universities were not
                            up to date with standards even after having nearly 8 years to adjust
                            since they were released in 2016.</p>
                            <p>Personally, I
                            find this worrying because of the large number of other nodes that
                            most college email accounts have access to. The fact that even the
                            more prestigious colleges in the US are failing on multiple levels in
                            their stated cybersecurity policies should raise alarm bells for
                            everyone, especially for college students. That's not even to mention
                            the kind of internal issues that institutions are susceptible to due
                            to these failures of policy.</p>
