                        <h2>Several states have sued TikTok for addictive features, and damaging youth mental health</h2>
                        <p><em>October 8, 2024</em></p>
                        <p>Just today, several states have filed lawsuits in state courts against TikTok, alleging harm 
                            to youth, according to 
                            <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-lawsuit-youth-mental-health-2993f8e70d2e3d4eab9988df168fb948">
                            The Associated Press</a>. Texas is suing specifically regarding their new 
                            law against data-collection of minors online. States specifically complain about the ability 
                            to endlessly scroll videos for hours on end, and default enabled push notifications that try 
                            to bring you back to the app while you're away. In addition, they reference the face filters 
                            on the app, which create unattainable standards of appearance for these youth in the videos 
                            they see.</p>
                        <p>This comes following the rulings in August by the federal government against google, which I 
                            discussed in my last post. It can be seen as another step forward as the government continues 
                            to actually punish companies who break laws or are otherwise actively harming internet users.</p>

                        <h2>2017 paper argues that counterspeech doesn't work online</h2>
                        <p><em>September 15, 2024</em></p>
                        <p>Recently
                        I read a <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-If-More-Speech-Is-No-Longer-the-Solution-First-Napoli/07a069f12fce08bf3c66d5b9866082db7b74bbd1">paper</a>
                        about the issues of fake news online. It was written in 2017
                        following the US Presidential Election of 2016, with a major theme
                        being investigating why fake news was so successful on this mostly
                        untested new platform for the dissemination of information. The
                        author argued that, in the online social media landscape, simply
                        advocating for counter speech no longer works to win against bad
                        ideas. That is, our first amendment principle of more speech being
                        the solution to bad speech (such as false claims, bad ideas, hate
                        speech, etc) only works under certain conditions, and those
                        conditions are not met in our current social media ecosystem.</p>
                        <p> The
                        author took the stance that social media platforms have a democratic
                        duty to fix the conditions such that good speech is able to win out
                        against bad speech again &ndash; essentially fix the rules to
                        actually incentivise truthful claims so they can win out in the
                        marketplace of ideas online. They also take a kind of position that
                        some of the work might also fall on government to enforce this kind
                        of thing as well.</p>
                        <p>Personally,
                        I think a major point missed perhaps was the glaring fact that we as
                        a culture are putting far too much stock in information that we find
                        online on social media. By moving away from a social media obsessed
                        viewpoint, we can instead reason and debate in the real world, where
                        the counterspeech works just fine. The issue is that society has a
                        false belief that good ideas come from social media at all. Though
                        perhaps the issue goes a bit deeper than that. After all, it might be
                        a little radical to expect the whole world to make a push away from
                        social media after adopting it so heavily.</p>

                        <h2>New paper about Noncomplience with Cybersecurity standards in Universities and Colleges of USA</h2>
                        <p><em>September 11, 2024</em></p>
                        <p>I
                        recently read a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00546">research
                        paper</a> over on Arxiv.org about cybersecurity in higher education.
                        The researches found that nearly all higher education institutions
                        are heavily lagging behind in updating their cybersecurity policies
                        as new standards are released by NIST. The paper, published August
                        2024, found that even high level, prestigious universities were not
                        up to date with standards even after having nearly 8 years to adjust
                        since they were released in 2016.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I
                        find this worrying because of the large number of other nodes that
                        most college email accounts have access to. The fact that even the
                        more prestigious colleges in the US are failing on multiple levels in
                        their stated cybersecurity policies should raise alarm bells for
                        everyone, especially for college students. That's not even to mention
                        the kind of internal issues that institutions are susceptible to due
                        to these failures of policy.</p>
