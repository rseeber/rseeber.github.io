                        <h3>"This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends" by Nicole Perlroth</h3>

                        <p>I highly reccomend that anyone interested in Political Science or Computers reads this. <br> <br>
                            Nicole Perlroth from The New York Times goes through the histroy of the "Zero-Day" exploit market, 
                            and how these exploits have come to be valued so much (many groups willing to pay hundreds of 
                            millions for just one potent Zero-Day). She explains that in the beginning, The United States used
                            to be the dominant force in cyberweapon development, and other countries were seen as incapable of
                            reaching their potential. In more recent years, Perlroth explains that more and more of our advisaries
                            have proven themselves perfectly capable of being seen as a proper threat to us.

                        <p>A really good book that I'm still working through. I reccomend anyone who uses social media for more than 30 minutes a day to read it.
                            It completely changed the way I look at my cellphone and computer. He advocates for only using technologies which are the best way to 
                            promote our endgoals, and to avoid technology that could be replaced with more effective solutions.</p>

                            <p>I've decided to host the ebook of this text on this site for free download, because I think it's an especially important read.

                        <h3>"Red Team Blues" by Cory Doctorow</h3>
                        <img class="bookCover" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1681104878i/60784417.jpg" alt="Cover for &quot;Red Team Blues&quot;. It has the title in red, over a blue background. A graphic of a man running into a keyhole is shown.">
                        <p>Highly entertaining fiction. We follow the story of Martin Hench, a security and hacking expert. He gets paid to unravel lies or exploits.
                            The story follows a part of his life as he gets involved in a big case that might be a bit over his head. If you're worried about overplayed
                            "one last job" or "expert hackerman" tropes, don't be, the story is handled very well and in a unique way.
                            The book includes a reasonable level of technical references, but you don't need to be a computer expert to follow along with what's happening.
                            I personally reccomend listening to the audiobook read by Whil Wheaton,
                            it's more than just an audiobook, it can feel more like an audiodrama the way Wheaton includes emotion into the readings.
                            <br><br>
                            This is book 1 in the "Martin Hench" series. I'm currently working my way through book 2, "The Bezzle".
