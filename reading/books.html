                        <p>Obama's second book, written in 2006 prior to his presidency. He writes from the perspective
                            of an Illinois US Senator about the need for our nation to unite on our common goals,
                            rather than our differences.</p>

                        <p>Goes over the ways that specialization into a field alone doesn't always yield success. Epstein
                            argues that we should be learning general skills that can be applied across the board, in addition
                            to the specialized skills we learn.

                        <p>Discusses the explosion of law over the past century. Argues that this much law traps the average
                            american. The book is told as a collection of real-life stories about regular, honest americans
                            who got hit with something by the government because they broke some obscure law that they
                            didn't know existed.
