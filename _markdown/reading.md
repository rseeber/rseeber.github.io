_Yeah, I read a lot of books concurrently. No, I am not fast at finishing them, that's why I do it in such a chaotic way. I'm trying to get better at it though._

<br>

- _The Nazi Movement_ (1938) by Theodore Abel
    + A history of the political context of the Hitler Movement, as well as a (then modern) history of how Hitler came to power. Written during WWII.
	+ ([OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL42887763M/The_Nazi_movement))

<br>

- _The Wealth of Nations: Book I_ (1776) by Adam Smith
	+ Adam Smith is often credited as being the 'Father of Capitalism' for his inquiry into how markets work in this book. Technically, he never really said the word Capitalism in the book, but that doesn't really matter. I've been trying to learn more about markets, so this has been an interesting read, and once you get used to the 18th century dialect, he's actually got a pretty engaging writers voice.

- _Lessons in Magic and Disaster_ (2025) by Charlie Jane Anders
	+ The copies for this finally arrived at the library, so I get to read it now. I know very little about it except that I heard about it from a review by Cory Doctorow. I just know it has themes of queer identity, family difficulties, magic, and all that fun stuff. So far I'm really enjoying it.

- _How to Argue With a Racist: What Our Genes Do (and Don't) Say about Human Difference_ (2020) by Adam Rutherford
	+ ([OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL28195872M/How_to_Argue_With_a_Racist))

<br>

- _The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich_ (1964) by George L. Mosse
    + A free giveaway I got from the library. I've been trying to do more learning about the rise of totalitarian governments and what allowed them to succeed. I'm finding this book pretty interesting.

# Future Reading List

- _1984_ (1949) by George Orwell

- _In Dubious Battle_ (1936) by John Steinbeck

- _How To Stand Up To A Dictator_ (2022) by Maria Ressa
    + Written by a Filipino journalist who has fought against her own authoritarian government in publishing stories critical of the then-President. I heard about this book from Jon Oliver's special on Trump & The Press.

- _All The President's Men_ (1974) by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward

- _Mein Kampf_ (1925) by Adolf Hitler
	+ I suppose it goes without saying that I read about the Hitler movement not because I admire it, but rather because I despise it so much, and would like to be able to help prevent similar movements as they arise in the future.

### September

- _The Caves of Steel_ (1953) by Isaac Asimov 
    + A detective case featuring Earthman Lije Baley partnered up with robot Daneel Olivaw from Spacetown, working to solve a murder case. Involves themes of social stratification, Luddism (under a different name), and the threat of automation.

## Older

- _Digital Minimalism_ by Cal Newport
    + 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is even mildly critical of their cellphone use.

- _This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends_ by Nicole Perlroth
    + Really good non-fiction about the use of cyberweapons by nation state actors. Told by a completely non-technical author, designed to be understood by technical and non-technical audiences alike.

- _Red Team Blues_ by Cory Doctorow
    + Fiction novel following a forensic accountant who is functionally a private investigator for the cyber and financial world. A really great novel, this series is what really turned me on to Cory's work in the first place.

- _Project Hail Mary_ by Andy Weir
    + Awesome scifi about an astronaut who wakes up with amnesia and has to piece together his situation while alone in space. Written by the same guy who wrote _The Martian_. I highly recommend it. I might even go back and re-read it at some point.

- _How to Interpret the Constitution_ by Cas Sunstein
    + Pretty cool overview of the debate around constitutional interpretation. He presents his own take only at the end of the book. I found it mostly unbiased, but you could still see his own perspective seeping in from time to time. Either way a great read, even if you end up disagreeing, you'll go away having much better reasons for feeling that way.

- _Permanent Record_ by Edward Snowden
    + An autobiography of his life, focusing mostly on his being a whistle blower of the NSA, exposing mass, warrantless surveillance of United States citizens by our government. Includes a lot of his own opinions as well, though I think that's fair given the context.
