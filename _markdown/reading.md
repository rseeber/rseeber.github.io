# Currently Reading

- _The Caves of Steel_ by Isaac Asimov 
    + My first Asimov novel, hoping to read plenty more!

- _The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich_ (1964) by George L. Mosse
    + A free giveaway I got from the library. I've been trying to do more learning about the rise of totalitarian governments and what allowed them to succeed. I'm finding this book pretty interesting.

# Have Reads

- _Digital Minimalism_ by Cal Newport
    + 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is even mildly critical of their cellphone use.

- _This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends_ by Nicole Perlroth
    + Really good non-fiction about the use of cyberweapons by nation state actors. Told by a completely non-technical author, designed to be understood by technical and non-technical audiences alike.

- _Red Team Blues_ by Cory Doctorow
    + Fiction novel following a forensic accountant who is functionally a private investigator for the cyber and financial world. A really great novel, this series is what really turned me on to Cory's work in the first place.

- _Project Hail Mary_ by Andy Weir
    + Awesome scifi about an astronaut who wakes up with amnesia and has to piece together his situation while alone in space. Written by the same guy who wrote _The Martian_. I highly recommend it. I might even go back and re-read it at some point.

- _How to Interpret the Constitution_ by Cas Sunstein
    + Pretty cool overview of the debate around constitutional interpretation. He presents his own take only at the end of the book. I found it mostly unbiased, but you could still see his own perspective seeping in from time to time. Either way a great read, even if you end up disagreeing, you'll go away having much better reasons for feeling that way.

- _Permanent Record_ by Edward Snowden
    + An autobiography of his life, focusing mostly on his being a whistle blower of the NSA, exposing mass, warrantless surveillance of United States citizens by our government. Includes a lot of his own opinions as well, though I think that's fair given the context.
