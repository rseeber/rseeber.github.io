#### Forums and documentation
- [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) - Best wiki for Unix and GNU software/tools, focused specifically for Arch Linux, but most information works on other OS's too

### Software
- [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird) - amazing email client that allows you to escape the grasp of google and microsoft mail clients, even if you're still bound to using them as your mail provider.
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) - for viewing, managing, and sharing ebooks
- [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en) - doesn't track your data like NordVPN and others
- [Linux operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) - Not for everyone, but the most free your computer will ever be. [Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) is a good flavor for beginners. Currently I'm using [Arch](https://archlinux.org/), which is catered towards more advanced users.
