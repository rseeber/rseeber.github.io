# How to follow my blog

There's a few different ways you can follow my [blog](/blog/), depending on your preferences and digital habits. I post links to all my new blog posts on the following platforms:

## Mastodon

<https://defcon.social/@riverpunk>

**@riverpunk@defcon.social**

## Bluesky

I've used [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) to duplicate my Mastodon account over to Bluesky, so you can follow me there instead if you like.

## Threads

My Mastodon account is also accessible via the Threads app (the Twitter clone made by Meta). First, you need to enable Fediverse Sharing: _Settings > Account > Fediverse Sharing (beta)_. Then just search my handle: 

**@riverpunk@defcon.social**.

## RSS

Of course, there's always the good old RSS feed. If you'd like to stay away from the social apps, you can keep up with my content by saving my [RSS Feed Link](/blog/feed.xml) into your preferred Feed Reader of choice.
