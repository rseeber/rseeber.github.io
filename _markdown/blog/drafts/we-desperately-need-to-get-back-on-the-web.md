title: We Desperately Need to Get Back on The Web
---

# Outline

- The "old internet" was amazing -> decentralized, web pages actually creating a web with many, many nodes
- Draw a comparison with all of the self-directed links that point within Wikipedia
	+ Wikipedia is not interconnected, it is a single node which mostly only links back to itself
	+ It's a great thing that it has so many pages that all link together, and Wikipedia doesn't need to change
	+ But if we had an entire web like this, but interconnected, we could reclaim the power of the old internet -> and internet that can deter censorship and also provide good and interesting information to its users, as it would become a collaborative effort of sharing interesting information with each other.

# Real outline
- So basically the internet is great
- It used to be amazing, but a lot of energy has been sucked away
- some of it died because it was just dot-com hype
- The internet has the capability to be a democracy enhancing tool
- We need it to be decentralized tho
- We need it to not be dictated by such faceless, obscure, unknowable algorithms
- It can't be controlled by 5 CEO's (realistically like, 3 companies own the internet right now -- Meta, Google, and Twitter)
- It needs to be controlled in a distributed manner. Each pocket is controlled by different parties.
- For people hosting their own sites, they have basically no rules except to keep things legal, since they're not relying on a social media platform to distribute their content (even if they're not "self-hosting", it's enough that they're using something like GitHub pages or NeoCities which makes _very few_ editorial decisions about content that is allowed to be posted).

- The web-based model of free speech works the best
- Plenty of people will have terrible terrible views from my perspective
- There is no opaque algorithm randomly shoving this content up my rectum
- I arrive at these expressions of speech which I find offensive by clicking from link to link, each page being a standard deviation of difference from the previous one
- This is because people tend to usually link to content that expresses similar viewpoints (this is simply the nature of how social interaction works), the only exception being critique, in which case it's clear that you're entering into territory of somebody who has a different viewpoint
- This would (perhaps?) create a middling effect, where extremists no longer are pushed to such ridiculous feats of purity testing, as the more moderate views would continually be within clicking range, if only we all had better access to them
- Why do I feel this way?

- Current algorithms have the tendency to take you for a ride through ideas, before dropping you into a broad but limited hole of ideology. 
- It's hard to escape that hole for peeps of alternate views without it corrupting the entire recommendation algorithm for you, and placing you into that new hole instead
- Basically, algorithms tend to emphasize leaning HEAVY into an ideological field, rather than promoting easy exploration of many viewpoints without changing the landscape with each new post you view.
- The web is much more intuitive to navigate and actually presents a more translucent way for users to SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE intellectually, and get a feel for the general landscape
- (Are there still biases? Of course there are. But that is a limitation of the way social graphs work, not a limitation of the internet or the web. It's a social issue based on the way people tend to interact with people and information, not an issue based on the way we link that information together)

- Okay so algorithms make it hard to explore, and they tend to nail you down into a specific pit and make it hard to leave that hole without abandoning all the stuff from it that you like, or leave it without becoming inundated with TOO MUCH content from what you're trying to explore
- But the web is better, because you can see what's out there better, you don't get trapped in extremist circles so quickly and so inescapably.
- Also, as the web is much more slow paced and reflective (at least a little bit), it leads to much less flame wars over dumb shit and rage bait and stuff
- Blogs require longer attention spans. Attention spans that might be capable of comprehending the nuance to the situation and thinking it through before responding as if everyone except for you is a fucking idiot who just needs to be enlightened to your way of thinking.

- As a side benefit, you get to escape from the trap of the corporate Big Tech ecosystem -- kind of anyways. At least escaping Meta and Twitter. Google might still be your search engine, but it doesn't have to be! That's the modular and decentralized nature of the web, you get to pick for yourself! It's not a monolith.
- Also also, the web can be a lot more artistically creative, if users want it to be -- but again, only if they want! Users are totally free to just host their blog on a bland site like Substack or something that requires no creativity beyond typing up the blog text and hitting upload.

- At some point perhaps I could talk about the experience of doing "Wikipedia deep dives", and the euphoria associated with. Take that idea, but then imagine it includes off-links -- links to other sites. Links to blog posts which include both opinions but also facts (backed up by sources, if it's a high quality blog -- otherwise, you'd go on a new deep dive digging up sources by searching online for them).
- In the year of our lord 2025, it is absolutely possible to go on an internet deep dive on an intellectually interesting topic (so, basically just not shallow) and bounce around on legitimate sources.
- It is _much easier_ to do this web surfing when it comes to intellectual pursuits that have non-objective answers.
	+ Looking into different theories of Libertarianism, economic policies, effective ideologies of activism (MLK, non-violence, ...etc)
- If more people were interested in this field, we'd have more content, but we'd also have something even more important -- more readers.
- The world spins on Social Media right now. Every politician uses it, nearly all voters use it. People are having their opinions formed by using it.
- The internet is the vessel upon which we are going to hold global and national debate regarding every important issue -- climate change, gender and racial equality, anti-science movements, the rise of totalitarianism across the globe.
- We will win or lose these debates on the ground of the internet. We will not predominantly be winning these by word of mouth conversation. 
- Internet is the new medium, and it's worth asking what we want that medium to really be shaped like.
- Even if most people didn't create their own blogs and personal sites, if we saw more people at least _using it_, thinking of it as a viable way of exploring information and opinions, they would have a portion of their minds being exposed in a more fair way to various ideas.
- There are only so many resources on the web, but it's still a lot right now. If readership increased, we would see publications increase to match.

- Minds would be made up using a method that promotes slower thinking, allowing the formation of nuanced thought patterns. It would lead to a less polarizing world, less fighting among humans who realistically share a lot in common. It would allow us to come together in a way that social media has made difficult, especially since the pivot to shorter and shorter content forms (see the 2019/2020 mass pivot to TikTok-style videos).
- Democracy would be improved if we could spend less time discussing our democracy on platforms that punish honest and rational thinking patterns.

# The internet is kinda shit right now
There's a growing feeling among people online that the internet is getting worse. Not just a little bit worse, but that specifically we are at a moment this decade where the internet has turned from some glorious thing into a perverse tool used to control us. People don't like technology right now. _Young people_ don't like technology. There's this growing feeling among my peers, and I'd presume it's present elsewhere in society too, that things are just getting _shitty_ right now online. Enshittification, I've heard it called. Technically that term is more specific than it's being used here, but I understand the sentiment. Things are getting crappy, Big Tech sucks, social media is terrible, everyone is using their phone's wayyy more than they probably should, and the internet has transformed in the span of 10 years from a wonderful tool that was seen as having the potential to help foster emerging democracies, into a weapon pointed at its user that seems almost intentionally trying to make our mental health worse.

(Pluralistic blog abt enshittification and semantic drift)
(report abt avg number of hours teens spend on their phones per day)
(some kind of link about Arab Spring -> even if the real impact of the internet is contested, the feelings were real. The feelings have changed. Why? Find a good source on at least the first part, bonus points if you include the second part as well)

[I like this paragraph a lotttt, let's clean it up and make sure it has the space to do what it's trying to do]
--->
At least, that's what it can feel like sometimes. That's the voice in my head at 2 AM when I realize I've been scrolling Instagram for far longer than I should have been, and think in that moment that I should get rid of all my apps and switch to a flip-phone. I then wake up in the morning, go to school, and proceed to open my 2FA app, my banking app, and then scan a QR code to fill out an online form, at which point I realize that maybe phones aren't the problem, it's just that Instagram is a terrible fucking app.
<---

## But what specifically makes it shit?
I think that's what a lot of us are working through right now. We all have these eerie feeling that there definitely is something wrong with the internet and our tech right now, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly what the issue is. It's hard to identify which uses of these now-ubiquitous tools are beneficial, and which ones are dangerously damaging to our mental health, our intelligence, or our relationships with others. It's hard to know what to criticize ourselves for doing, and what doesn't matter. When everything tech related gets shoved into a tiny little box, it's hard to figure out which uses of that box serve you, and which are vices that you foolishly lean into.

Some might be quick to say that the whole notion of smartphones is the problem, but I'd say that's not it (see my example with 2FA, banks, and QR codes). Having a little computer in my pocket is amazing. My problem mostly stems from when I'm spending hours and hours on it in a state of being unhappy. This really only happens for me on social media. The only social media I still have is Instagram. I used to use other social media apps too, but I realized I didn't care about the other ones. Reddit and Twitter have no place in my life, they were just entertainment boxes. Instagram, on the other hand, actually does serve a purpose, and that's kinda what makes the whole scenario so unbearable.

# Purposes of Instagram

The thing about Instagram is that it's socially useful. It's not _just_ a time waister. It purports to connect us. It allows us to share things with each other easily. Creative and personal expressions. It gives us control over who sees what, with control over private accounts, and even letting us make posts just for "Close Friends", a more select group of your followers.

It's got some pretty robust texting features, and it feels really natural. On the other hand, it's also terrible, and most people I know have at least some level of resentment towards it. If you _don't_ resent the app, you can disregard this blog post, there are plenty of people already talking about _why_ platforms like Instagram are toxic, I'm here to discuss what we can do about it.

## Find replacements

The best thing you can do to start out is to find any features of Instagram you currently use, and see if there are any other platforms or services you could be using instead. The first and easiest thing to do is to move your text conversations off of Instagram and over to your phone number SMS texting.

The harder part involves the creation and sharing of a kind of online persona. Plenty of social media critics like to criticize the idea of an online persona, but I think there's a valid creative expression in that. Taking photos -- of yourself, of your travels, of your notebooks, travel locations, friends, nature, etc -- and posting them online is a way to express yourself. That's not vain. Nor is it vain to post videos of you playing music, or post writings online (although I can't say Instagram is particularly well suited to the medium). I think at the end of the day, one of the biggest reasons people use Instagram is because they want to share some part of themselves. Whether it's something they create, or simply some kind of identity or aesthetic. We're dying for connection.

So what if we posted this stuff elsewhere? What if we stopped relying on a singular platform to distribute this stuff? The whole reason we're stuck on Instagram is because it's locked in. You can't leave Instagram without leaving your friends. But you can't open Instagram without being bombarded by a wave of design choices that leave you feeling terrible even just a few minutes into the experience, before you're even done looking at what your friends have posted. And after you've seen it all, you often find yourself accidentally lost in a feed of content you never asked to be shown.

## Where do we post stuff then?

My recommendation? Put it on the web. If you're a visual artist, make a Flickr or a DeviantArt. Share your work with your friends. The point of these platforms is that they're open to view just from a regular web browser without needing to log in. You can just send a link and a person can open that link and look at your stuff. The way you get content isn't by following a user on a single, monolithic service, through their single, monolithic app, whereby the service will promise with 60% certainty to show their stuff on your home page when they make a post.

Instead, you just go to the link, look at it when there's new stuff. People don't tend usually wanna just hit refresh on a link all the time, so usually you'll actually have to send your friends the link when you post a new cool thing that you want them to look at. Is this a bug, or a feature? It might be a bug. It sucks that your friends can't just automatically see it, hit like, move on with their day. Or maybe it's a feature. It facilitates a conversation between the two of you. It ensures that they actually think about looking at your stuff. It gets rid of the anxiety about checking your post analytics with all the likes and comments after you hit publish.

Of course, there's plenty of services you can use. I mention Flickr and DeviantArt because they let you easily post stuff online, and they don't require viewers to sign in before looking at it. You can share a link and a viewer clicks it and it shows up without any fuss. There are other options. The _most_ extensible is to host your own website. Not everyone wants to do that. Some might want to host a blog, if they prefer writing over visual art. Some might make blog where they just put up poetry. A blog doesn't have to be this super serious thing. You can write silly things, you can write about your experience at a Ren Faire, or a local event. You just put things you might otherwise put on a social media. Maybe you can make it a little longer -- the medium frees you up to the option of that -- but you don't have to. There's no rule that says you can't write a 100 word blog post. Lots of blogs let you upload images too, if you wanna include pics of your stories.

Here's the thing. There was a time when "The Web" was where things got stored. You had something you wanted to put online so your friends could see it, share it with a community, as a way of publicizing your creative expression? The place you would put it is a page on The Web. The Web is not a single thing. It's not a server in a room at Google or Meta. It's not anywhere specific. If you want your stuff online, you don't actually have to put it on a Meta or Google server. You just need it on _some_ computer, somewhere. _Anywhere_. If it's on that computer and being publicly hosted, you're online.

This is a system that deters censorship. This is a free speech haven. You don't need anybody important's permission to publish information online, you just need some nerd with a computer to be willing to host it for you (for instance, by using a service like GitHub Pages, NeoCities, Substack, etc). You just need to get it up on a single server somewhere, and you're online. 

New content on the web is not discovered by using some kind of recommendation engine that hyper analyzes every single one of your clicks you've ever had, and determines what content you want to look at in the current moment. Instead, there are two general means to find stuff on the web. The first way is through RSS feeds, which give you updates when a site you follow posts a new page. The other way is through simply surfing the web, navigating across the graph of websites by following hyperlink to hyperlink.

In many ways, the medium of the web is a lot better than social media. The web is a lot easier to look at on the web, it's not viewed by people who are sitting bored in line looking for 7 minutes to kill mindlessly. The web tends to be viewed with much more intentionally. Each new page is loaded with intentionally. You have to click a link taking you to the next one, which tends to come with some kind of context of what this next page is. Compare this to the thoughtless scrolling from one post to the next in a feed of posts. You don't make a decision when you scroll to the next post. But when you click a hyperlink, you're making a _very_ intentional decision.

# Instagram is a demon from the fiery pits of Hell
There's a game of chess going on in everyone's mind right now who feels like tech is hurting them somehow and who's trying to figure out what to change to fix the problem. There's one side of thinking that says that INSTAGRAM IS THE PROBLEM. That side is not wrong. If you're anything like a lot of the people my age who feel this way, you're probably spending 4-6 hours on Instagram per day, with most of that time having very little to do with interacting with your friends.

But then the other side of your brain shouts back, it's telling you that Instagram is a wonderful technology. The fact that you can have a centralized hub of connection. It's ubiquitous, to the point that it's become a de facto platform for managing contacts when you meet somebody interesting at a party and what to stay in touch later. Your brain is saying that this is a platform for people who want to engage with their friends. It allows you to easily converse with them, and it gives you a presence. It's also kind of fun, and should we ban that? Must everything be serious and purposeful?

Of course, my take goes down the middle. I think Instagram provides something incredibly useful, and that it's taken us hostage and added a lot of terrible features that make every moment on the app as miserable as possible. At the same time, they've made it as hard as possible to get away from the app. They block all 3rd party client software, they removed their old DMs only app (it was called 'Threads', apparently they wanted to revive the name when they made their Twitter clone app that nobody uses), and if you dare switch to the browser so you can install browser plugins that remove explore feed posts from your home page, they just change their app so that the plugin no longer works. They lock us in to their app, and then they make the app SUCKKKK. Okay, _now_ you can call it enshittification.

I'm not saying all this just to take a dump on Meta or Big Tech. The point of this post is not primarily political. I'm trying to offer a practical way of moving forward in the current landscape, not calling for reforms to create a new landscape (that's not to say reforms aren't absolutely needed. Point aside though).
<--

# How do we proceed with this knowledge?
What can we do?

My recommendation is to isolate the key features you feel Instagram provides, which you _simply cannot_ get elsewhere. If you can get the thing somewhere else, might as well go there instead, that way you can avoid the mental hell that is that app. One of the first things to go is most texting. Everybody has a phone number. If you text often, just get your friend's phone number, text them on SMS. Some people like to use Discord, that work too if they check it. But don't use Instagram for texting if you hate the app.

## Creative expression through posting
Above just texting, I feel that there's an element of human connection through expression. I make a post about something. My friends see it. My friends tell me about it, and it makes me feel seen. Makes me feel less alone in this incredibly isolating world. I think this is a worthwhile use if it makes you feel good. For me, I never really used to post stuff on Instagram. I don't have a picture perfect body, and I don't go to interesting places that often. I didn't fit the shape of Instagram, but now that I've begun blogging, I see the appeal. For people who are more visual than I am (perhaps they do paintings, or nature photography, or they just live somewhere pretty that lends itself better to interesting posts than the desert of my hometown), Instagram seems like a great outlet for creativity and expression. For me, I prefer writing, but that's just me. It takes all kinds. And obviously more mediums exist than just text or images. If your goal is simply to connect with some friends of yours, maybe incidentally wanting it to be posted publicly for others to see, or maybe not being public at all -- there's options for you outside of Instagram. Yes, your friends are all on Instagram. It's easier. But it also hurts like shit, remember? The app suckkkks, let's brainstorm some options.

A quick option is to look into image hosting services for artists. Flickr, DeviantArt, both options that I've seen used by many artists. You don't have to be a professional to adopt a site like this. It can just be a dorky thing you do on the side, something you be absolutely no good at. That's fine. Your friends don't even have to necessarily follow you back. Tell them about your gallery when you're hanging out, or text them when you make a post, ask them what they think of it.

This kind of serves a double purpose. You're getting your creative expression and sharing it with people you love, but you're also doing so in a less streamlined way. You have to get the attention of your friends. They notice that, it creates friction. This is somehow seen as a "bad thing" by some people, but I think that's a ridiculous viewpoint. Friction is good. Friction is the static upon which an actual interaction can take place. The fact that your friends don't just randomly see your image in a feed of posts they mindlessly scroll means that when you text it to them, it's special. They feel special because you thought to reach out to _them specifically_. It also presents a chance for the two of you to actually talk to one another. Maybe about the thing you sent, or maybe they remember they've been meaning to invite you to some event, or to ask you a question they've been wanting the answer to for a while. The friction creates contact between two people.

If your goal is just to be mindlessly viewed by 100 people who don't give a shit, and 12 people who maybe care just a little bit, and then 3 friends who hype you up, I mean, that's your deal I guess. But if maybe that kind of environment ends up making you feel more isolated than connected, maybe posting on a different platform would be the way to go.

On top of that, it's modular. It's grab and go. You can be on Flickr, and then decide that they're putting too many ads, so you move to DeviantArt. You could even make your own website, if you're somewhat computer savvy and up for the challenge (it's not that hard! Though it requires some more work than the other choices here). 

The internet used to be The Web. The Web used to "The World Wide Web" -- that's what the "www" stands for at the beginning of most website URLs. We had this grandiose idea of an interconnected world. A massive graph, billions of pages pointing to one another with hyperlinks, taking you to all kinds of pages around this massive network. That was the idea.

Now? We see it as an insurmountable problem if we want to distribute content to like, 12 friends or less, if we're not going to be posting it on one particular platform. If it's not going to show up on this one specific web page (which is also an app), then it seems almost impossible to get this small collection of humans to just look at it. What happened to us? Why do we feel this way? Instagram LITERALLY allows you to post links on your story that anybody who sees it can click to leave the app and go to your gallery.

What's going on? Have we become so neutered as a society? The idea of surfing from 1 massive website to a slightly less massive website seems like a hurdle. What's the deal, why is this so hard now?

# Okay so maybe I am calling for a reshaping of our tech landscape

I think we should adjust from our current model. Big Tech needs regulation, but I'm tired of sitting around and waiting. I think maybe our society needs to wake the fuck up and do something already. We know that the monolithic nature of Social Media is harmful. Social Media might have good in it, and sure, we can keep using it, but we need to get back on the web. We need to get back to the idea that the internet can connect vast and disparate repositories of information together. We need to get back to the idea that hopping from one web page to another is like, kinda the whole point?

I guess we just need to stop framing out internet usage as "I'm gonna sit down and use Instagram" (or whatever service). If we're going to sit on our mini computers, it should be in an attempt to connect to the greater internet at large. Instagram only contains so much. If we refuse to even look at other places, we're letting Meta win their game. We need to exercise flexibility.



# drafting note

Okay I think the point is being missed in the diction and rhetoric. The point is that we need to realize that there are other places online that can store our stuff. You can create a website. You can create a blog (which doesn't require you to do almost anything if you use a service like substack or something). You can have a linktree and post it EVERYWHERE. People can see all your stuff by looking at linktree.

I also feel like there's this trend for artsy types to be like, "go on the indie web! Delete Instagram and just use NeoCities !!" This is dumb. Especially when it comes from this feeling that like, the internet needs to have more juvenile expressions of art on it. I think the NeoCities style is cute or whatever, but I don't care. The power of the IndieWeb isn't bullshit aesthetics that make it look like a 2-year-old made it. The point is that it's open, accessible, and then also it needs to be easy to create. The point is that it's on the WEB. The web is great. Fuck it, substack, linktree, wordpress, they're all IndieWeb in my mind. Do they look corporate? Yeah, so what? The point isn't 90's nostalgia, the point is open, accessible, enshittification resistant, and doesn't make you feel like shit after you use it. The web does that. The 90's nostalgia exist BECAUSE the web does that. We need IndieWeb, not Cutesy Web. If you want to make cutesy stuff, go ahead, it's amazing and I eat that shit up all day, but it's not the solution. The solution is accessible tools that work and which are open by design, preventing lock-in.

Ad-free, algorithm-free, bullshit-free experience.

88x31 buttons are not going to save the internet, but the technology that allowed for their easy proliferation (the web, embedding technology, the fact that you can LINK TO SHIT FROM _OTHER_ SERVERS AND PAGES EASILY) very much _can_ save us. We need a return to the open internet, where content can link to other content easily. Information can quickly be referenced and automatically materialize in other content. We need a return to an internet where a vast array of servers and websites existed, not a collection of 5, all filled with screenshots of the other 4. We need an internet that is, in other words, The Web. We need to return to the design and principles of what the web was. Tim Burners-Lee is often talked about in discussions about the internet. But he didn't create the internet. What he created was the web. He knew computers could connect to one another, but it suckkked. Everything was hidden, you had to fight to get multiple pages about the same topic. You had to fight to find things. Browsing information was terrible. He created a system where you could link to related documents on the internet. He created a web, which allowed you to easily surf between related pages, so long as the creator of the page felt it worthwhile to include links to such pages. You didn't have to go searching one page at a time. You just follow the link.

We need to get back to the web. We need to get back to the ability to just go from one page to another. Please get me out of this enshittocene already.
