title: We Desperately Need to Get Back on The Web
---

# The internet sucks right now
- Enshittification is ruining things.
- People simply don't like social media --> it's a spiky technology that sucks ass

# Politics is to blame, but what can we do in the meantime?
- Yeah, Big Tech and monopoly stuff is to blame. Who cares. What do I do RIGHT NOW so I stop feeling like shit?
- Maybe we get a cultural shift, but who knows

## Get off of social media
- If doing xyz thing hurts, then uhh, don't do xyz thing.
- Get off social media if it hurts
- Also, social media sucks, here's some reasons
	+ The medium is catered towards short form content
	+ It discourages slow, contemplative, or nuanced thinking
	+ It gives you anxiety cuz you're checking it impulsively
	+ It makes you feel like shit about yourself --> FOMO, Body Dysmorphia

- At the same time, there are benefits that keep us there
	+ We like the outlet for expression
	+ We like being able to connect
	+ We probably like a few things that are actually bad for us on social media, idk

### How do we replace it?
- We need a new outlet for expression
- The web is an open outlet, which doesn't have all the restrictions and closed technology of social media.
	+ The web can be anything. Personal websites are best, but they can be difficult.
	+ If not a personal website, a blog is very easy to run through services like substack, bearblogs, or other tools. All you need to make it the text.
	+ BLOGS DON'T NEED TO BE FANCY OR NICE
		* The point is that they're you.
		* It can be Low Fidelity. It's better that way. You show it to your friends, that's the point. Maybe some other ppl see it too.
	+ You can host visual media on a personal website, or on something like Flickr, DeviantArt, whatever you want. The point is to find an open outlet. Ppl should be able to look at it by just clicking a link, without needing to log in.

# The internet sucks right now

The internet kind of sucks right now. Google search is terrible, social media sucks, and everything is competing for your attention. I could go into these claims, back some of them up with evidence, but the truth of the matter is that everyone already has an intuitive understanding that this stuff is at least true on _some level_. The internet literally just does suck to a lot of people. That doesn't mean the internet is _bad_, but it does highlight the fact that there's some problems. This is the reason that the term '_enshittification_' has become so popular with people. It's because, even if we can't always describe, how or why, we have this basic understanding that a lot of things on the internet are _just shitty_ right now. When properly defined, enshittification is, of course, a specific process with specific economic and material incentives. It's only one of many ways that a lot of things are getting shitty right now online, but one could perhaps argue it's a major driver of the overall process. I won't be going into that argument though.

The point is, a lot of people overall have a general feeling like the internet is getting kind of sucky right now. Plenty of people have made very good arguments about the political drivers of this process, and called for changes to the system. I tend to agree with these folks.

But, to be entirely honest, __I'm tired of waiting__. 

I don't want to wait for our political system to be restructured before I stop feeling like shit when I'm online. I want solutions _now_. I want personal solutions that I can implement in my own life that yield immediate benefits, and they can't amount to "just stop using digital tools" -- computers aren't evil, and I refuse to give up on their potential for good.

# Identify the problem
# (Get off social media)

So, the biggest piece of the internet that people tend to complain about is social media. People use social media so much that it becomes difficult for us to see it at all at times. Note the common tendency for people to refer to social media as simply 'the internet'. That's all it is now, to many people, social media simply _is_ the internet. I get it. It's the thing people most commonly use, the easiest way to spread information is to post about it on one of a small number of these social platforms. And of course, social media is a _part of_ the internet, there's no argument there.

I guess what I'm trying to point out is the way we forget that social media is just one way you can use the internet, and that if we forget that, we also forget that there are other options for digital interconnection besides just social media.

Social media is the thing people I talk to tend to dislike most about the current internet. There's the so-called "addicting" features that they dislike (of course, lots of people are keen to mention that it's not really addiction based on well accepted definitions of the term. Hank Green has a really good video about what it is instead.) There's also the kind of polarizing content that the medium of social media tends to generate. Social media doesn't promote nuance or slow, contemplative thinking. It promotes jumping to conclusions, caring far too much about things that do not matter, and purity testing (especially in the political parts of social media, although I'd argue it's also seen in other places too. Just take a look at the pointless arguments and purity tests that happen all the time on sites like Reddit).

I'm not really here to encourage you to hate social media. You either are looking for ways out, or you like the system. This article is for people who already aren't content with the way things are, so I'm not gonna spend too much effort detailing the problems. This is going to be an article about _solutions_ to that problem.

# What Are We Trying to Replace?

Before we talk alternatives, we need to identify what it is exactly that we're trying to actually replace. What do we like about social media that we want to keep? What parts do we want to _not_ include?

Here's a list of some of the parts of social media that I personally like, and think we should hold on to:

- It's easy to get started, and you don't need a lot of technical knowledge to put stuff online now.
- You can keep track of the stuff your friends post easily (that's the idea, anyways).
- It's easy to share your profile with others in just a few seconds of work -- especially on mobile, like at a party.
- You can reach out and explore the greater depths of the internet beyond just who you follow. (This is often done by platforms by looking at the social graph of friendships and generating recommendations based on those connections, or otherwise through some explore feed of content).
- Social media is an outlet for which we can express ourselves in some way creatively, and share that expression with our friends.

There's plenty of other good bits about social media, but these are the big ones for me, so I'm gonna keep it limited to this. So what we're basically looking for is something that lets us easily post things, not necessarily needing technical know-how to get it online. We also want to easily share our online presence with someone else, and we want to be able to keep track of any new posts that our friends we're following make. And then we need some way to branch out as well -- content discovery, basically.

But while doing this, we want to avoid some of the problems with social media. We don't want our replacement to be centrally controlled by a single entity that could suddenly decide to change things up, make the platform worse. This happened to both Facebook and then later Instagram. These platforms started as _genuienely good_, they were places that people were flocking to, trying to escape the last iteration of social media that had gone bad. The new iteration was considered a "good social media", up until the point where they followed the pattern of the previous iteration everyone escaped from, and turned to shit as well. We want to use something that won't easily succumb like this.

The way to prevent that is to use something decentralized, where control is spread among several entities. Where you can join the platform using a number of different providers. This way, if you don't like one provider, you can always switch to another, while still staying on the same general platform, so you don't have to leave your friends.

This is how the best technology that sticks around the longest works. Email works like this. You might have Outlook, but I have Gmail. We're both "on email" so to speak, but through different providers, yet it's all one platform, and we can still both talk to each other. I can later leave Gmail for Proton Mail, and _still_ talk to you, just under a different email address. This is also how SMS and calling works. You have one phone provider, I have another, we can still text or call each other. If you switch providers, I just need your new number, no hassle.

As a final point, we also might want to avoid the short-form style of modern social media. If we're leaving social media because we feel it's damaging our mental health, leaving to a platform that pushes you to quickly consume as many short bursts of vapid information droplets as possible might not be a good idea. We should be going for platforms that promote slower thinking, more contemplation, nuance, and less polarization of the supposed "others" in ideology or culture. Presumably, the internet is designed to bring people together, maybe it would be worth looking at digital tools that actually promote oneness, not just bringing people together so they can have more arguments with one another.

Anyways, with all that in mind, we're looking for some way to create a presence online for ourselves using a tool that accomplishes all of this. Decentralized, easy to use, promotes longer thinking, and allows us to creatively express ourselves and show it to our friends.

# Use The Web

One of the best ways to accomplish this is to simply use the web. This is the best way we can make sure our content stays accessible. If one provider goes to shit, decides to make the experience worse for the user, we can simply grab our content, bring it to a different platform, and declare that to be our new home online.

The technology we're describing and looking for luckily already exists. It's The World Wide Web. Or, obviously just "The Web" if you're not trying to sound like a massive dorkwad. The Web was invented in 1989 by Tim Burners-Lee. The Web is _not_ the internet, it's a subset of the internet. The Web is just the parts of the internet that you can view through your web browser -- so, basically just websites. The Web was designed in such a way that you could have a massive, unknown number of independent servers all hosting content, and where that content could all be linked around to other content hosted elsewhere on the web. The connections between pages are 'hyperlinks', or just 'links' as we call them today.

So, okay, we've got the part where it's not owned by any single person or group, but what about the rest? How does The Web satisfy the rest of our needs?

Well, it's easy to share your online presence. Simply give the link to your friend to your page. Either type it by hand, or send it over an existing platform you share with them. It's also easy to keep up with new posts your friends make. There's a technology called RSS. Basically, the idea is that a certain webpage can "support RSS" by including a special little file on the site that they update when new posts are made. The service you use will often do this automatically for you, you don't even have to think about it. Your friends will then just download something called an "RSS Reader", basically a special app that will check this file for each site you're trying to stay up to date on, and it will let you know if there's been any new posts by any of them. This means you can be subscribed to a large number of sites, but you don't need to manually check each one every day -- you can just check your RSS Reader, and only click on the source if there's a notification icon for that specific page. Basically, it lets you keep track of the posts that your friends make on the web, all in one neat spot.

Of course, given the way that everything is linked together, it should be easy to surf the web, following from link to link, and use that as your method for content discovery. This relies on a good culture of sharing interesting things we found on the web, but what else would we rather rely on for finding new things _other_ than culture? Algorithms? Those are already _based_ on the culture that it scrapes up from user behavior! I don't suppose why this might be any less effective. Anybody who's spent any time on Wikipedia before will be well aware of the power of following links down rabbit holes, and learning new things. Plus, if links tend to direct towards other sites that are also personal sites, it doesn't just land you on one interesting _page_ -- it takes you to a whole _person_. They might have more interesting stuff, and you can follow them too, adding their site to your RSS Reader. I would say this is a viable method for content discovery.

There's also our requirement for it to promote longer patterns of thinking, being less short-form. I think it's maybe clear that The Web easily fulfills that goal. There is no central feed which you can endlessly scroll. Every decision to seek out a new piece of content is based on an intentional decision to click some link, a _specific_ link that you found interesting based on the context of what the previous page said about what you would find.

You're more likely to engage in deeper thinking on a platform like this, if we can even call The Web a platform.


Of course, I'm not calling for everybody to make a website, that would be ridiculous. Most people don't know how to do that, and really they don't care enough. I mean, I think people _should_, it's fun, it's creative, it's the best way to host content online, but it's too high of an expectation. There's other ways to be on the web. Plenty of blogging platforms exist. You just make an account, it gives your blog a home page (usually something like '_username_._bloggingPlatform_.net' or whatever). You can post your written content to this page, and that way you don't have to host the site or plan any of the HTML. You just have to decide what to words to put on the page.

If writing isn't your preferred form of expression, you probably would prefer using images. DeviantArt is a site that exists which you can host your artwork on. There's technically no reason you couldn't also put up other things, like photography, or images of something physical you've created. If you don't wanna use DeviantArt, you could upload to Flickr instead, or really any of the other thousand image hosting websites. In fact, once you've uploaded the pictures to some service, you could right click the 'open image in new tab' button, and copy the link to get the location for that image. From there, you can embed that image into a blog. This way you can put images on a site hosting service, even if they say they won't host your images for you. That's because you found a way to host the image on a different service.

# The Big Picture

Here's the point. If you don't like social media, you need to get away from it. You need to get yourself out of the walled garden and into something more friendly. The best way to do that is to get on a service which can be accessed via the standard interface of The Web. All someone has to do is type the proper URL into the address bar and they're taken to your page.

If the service you're using goes bad, and you would rather use a better option? Make an account on a different service on The Web, there's plenty to choose from. Make a post announcing your move on the old site. You might choose to re-upload your back catalog of works to the new service, but you don't have to. It's really that easy. The system is deterrent against erosion.

Of course, this won't be the same experience as social media. You've changed mediums, and the content will adjust to fit the new medium. You might have been on Twitter microblogging about small life updates, or silly pictures, or random shower thoughts that appeared in your head. You can still talk about this stuff. A home on the web doesn't have to be serious. You can write an 100 word blog post about the raccoon you saw on your way to work, along with a blurry image you took of it while it scurried away. Why not? The medium is unconstraining. There's no reason a blog can't function as a microblog. Just this time, it's on the open space of The Web, not the locked down walled-garden of Twitter, where algorithms push content, and everyone is hostile and terrible to be around.

As you spend longer getting accustomed to the new format, you might notice that things start to take shape into the new medium. You'll keep your microblog format, but the energy will change. You're no longer appealing to a distracted audience that's looking for easy, short burst posts. You don't need to rush your words across the page. You can describe a scene in detail. You can spend more than 1 sentence setting up an intro.

The content stays the same, but the overall presentation changes. You prevent your content from showing up in some hyper-algorithmic feed. People no longer find your content by simply scrolling their homepage. They find it by consciously deciding to look for it. By opening their RSS reader, which is where they keep up with new posts on the web, or by choosing to visit your page and check for updates manually. Or hey, maybe they found it because somebody that _they follow_ thought it was interesting, and linked to it in one of _their_ pages.


# Using Closed Services to "Escape" Social Media? Really?

Some of the more techno-libertarians might be scoffing at me right now. They have their decentralized, federated Mastodon client opened up. They're already Tooting (Mastodon's name for "tweets") to Richard Stallman about my over-reliance of closed-source services, and how a truly open web wouldn't make use of such things.

I mean, maybe there's truth to saying that _relying_ on centralized platforms in an attempt to utilize the potential of the web is a good idea. But, I'm not really advocating for _reliance_. I just think people should use the tools that they know how to use. If you're not tech savvy enough to host a website, why not just use some simpler services instead to host _content_ instead of a whole website layout. You probably don't even want to create the layout, that sounds like work. I didn't make my website's template, I just grabbed one from online and tweaked the colors and a few details to make it mine (thanks Sadgrl!). Using a service means you can be up and running with little effort, and you can rely on the service itself to handle what the template looks like, and how to host stuff online.

<br>

All this is great, but of course it's important that you really don't actually _rely_ on the platform. If you start telling people to look at your stuff by following you through the app or website, or if you only save your work by posting it to the site, without keeping external backups, you're relying on the platform. You're making it difficult to leave if it ever starts getting bad. You want to easily be able to switch services, and the only real update your followers have to make is that they change their bookmark, or their RSS link for your stuff. You also want to be able to copy all your old posts to the new site, if you need to leave ever.

Ideally, you'll choose services that are more friendly to their users instead of ones that seem already half enshittified. It just makes more sense for you in the long run, you won't have to switch so soon, maybe not ever. If it's a small project run on the passion of the team actually liking the idea of creating a good tool, it might never go to shit.


# I'm Sold, What Now?

So maybe you're on board with the idea, and you wanna give this a try, but you're wondering what you would do. What is your presence on the web going to look like? Well, here's some ideas.

Maybe you're coming from Instagram. If you were posting posting photos you like taking on hikes, you might try still posting them on a photo sharing service. Either use that as your place online, or, you could take those photo links, embed them into a blog or webpage, and talk about them. If you feel extra creative, you could talk about why they were interesting to you, or you could save a bunch of them up, and make a massive post all at once, where you also do some writing underneath.

Or you don't do that. Maybe you just post it to Flickr with a 5 word caption and call it a day. It really is up to you.

If you're not a photography or visual art type, maybe you used Social Media to express thoughts. Maybe you used to do long Instagram story posts filled with text. Or maybe you used to post poetry. Or, even if you just liked to say random stuff about your day. You could try blogging. Find a good provider. I recommend drafting your posts on a text document on your computer before copy-pasting or uploading online. The editors for a lot of these services kind of sucks. It's better to write it in your own preferred interface. As I said earlier, your blog can be short, unserious. It isn't deep, it's just yourself. The whole point of the Web 2.0 movement was to let The Web become personal, full of individual expression, not just "important" or "serious" web pages.
