<p>I'm a Computer Science student at AVC, planning to minor in Political Science.</p>
<p><strong>Some of my bigger interests include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Security and Hacking</li>
    <li>Politics and Cyberweapons</li>
    <li>Computer Networks</li>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Math and Physics</li>
    <li>Photography (<em><u>all images on this site are my own!</u></em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about anything I post on my site, or just wanted to send me something you think I should read, 
    feel totally free to send me an <a href="/about">email</a>! I really don't mind getting emails 
    when it's from actual people instead of automated mailing lists. :)</p>
