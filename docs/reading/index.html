                        <h1>Currently Reading</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The Caves of Steel</em> by Isaac Asimov</p>
<ul>
<li>My first Asimov novel, hoping to read plenty more!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich</em> (1964) by George L. Mosse</p>
<ul>
<li>A free giveaway I got from the library. I've been trying to do more learning about the rise of totalitarian governments and what allowed them to succeed. I'm finding this book pretty interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Have Reads</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Digital Minimalism</em> by Cal Newport</p>
<ul>
<li>10/10 would reccomend to anyone who is even mildly critical of their cellphone use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends</em> by Nicole Perlroth</p>
<ul>
<li>Really good non-fiction about the the use of cyberweapons by nation state actors. Told by a completely non-technical author, designed to be understood by technical and non-technical audiences alike.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Red Team Blues</em> by Cory Doctorow</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiction novel following a forensic accountant who is functionally a private investigator for the cyber and financial world. A really great novel, this series is what really turned me on to Cory's work in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Project Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir</p>
<ul>
<li>Awesome scifi about an astronaught who wakes up with amnesia and has to piece together his situation while alone in space. Written by the same guy who wrote <em>The Martian</em>. I highly reccomend it. I might even go back and re-read it at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How to Interpret the Constitution</em> by Cas Sunstein</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty cool overview of the debate around constitutional interpretation. He presents his own take only at the end of the book. I found it mostly unbiased, but you could still see his own perspective seeping in from time to time. Either way a great read, even if you end up disagreeing, you'll go away having much better reasons for feeling that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Permanent Record</em> by Edward Snowden</p>
<ul>
<li>An autobiography of his life, focusing mostly on his being a whistleblower of the NSA, exposing mass, warrentless surrveilance of United States citizens by our government. Includes a lot of his own opinions as well, though I think that's fair given the context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
